## Research question

An investigator wishes to study lung function in relation to smoking
behavior. People are classified into four categories: nonsmokers (category
1), former smokers who stopped smoking more than two years ago, called early
smokers (category 2), former smokers who stopped smoking within the past two
years, called recent smokers (category 3), and current smokers (category
4). The lung function of each person is measured by the volume of air (in
liters) that can be forcibly expired in the first second of exhalation. It
is referred to as FEV1.

The main questions are:

1. Does smoking status affect mean FEV1?
2. Can we distinguish nonsmokers from early smokers based on the available
   measures?
3. Is there any evidence of a polynomial trend between FEV1 and smokers
   category when considering that smoking status can be graded from
   nonsmokers to current smokers?


## Loading data in R

Individual data are available in the file smoking-data.dat. Instructions to load
this data set in R are given below. Note that current smoking status, which
appears in the first column in the data file, is coded as integer values
following the description given in the preceding section.

> f <- read.table("smoking-data.dat", header=FALSE)
> names(f)
[1] "V1" "V2"
> str(f)
'data.frame':	24 obs. of  2 variables:
 $ V1: int  1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 ...
 $ V2: num  4.41 4.96 3.5 3.66 4.68 4.11 3.69 3.9 3.82 4.08 ...

Note that there are no variable names, so it might be convenient to add some
relevant names.
