Using a Rmarkdown custom report, you are asked to answer the following
questions:

1. (a) Give a numerical summary of FEV1 (mean, standard deviation and range)
   for each smoking category (recoded as a categorical variable with
   appropriate levels), and for all subjects (grand mean and overall
   standard deviation). Results should be printed in one or two Tables. (b)
   Use box-and-whiskers charts or density plots to show the distribution of
   individual values.

2. Carry out a one-way ANOVA to test the null hypothesis that the age at
   breast cancer diagnosis does not depend on smoking category.
   (a) Formulate your conclusion in plain English, and
   (b) report the percentage of explained variance.

3. (a) Use post-hoc Tukey HSD tests (R command: TukeyHSD) to compare all
   pairs of means among the four groups of smokers. Summarize point
   estimates and 95% confidence intervals in a Table or graphical display,
   and indicate which pairs of means are found to be significantly different.
   (b) Compare those results with results from all pairwise comparisons for
   mean FEV1 using the Bonferroni method (R command: pairwise.t.test).

4. Is there any evidence for a linear or quadratic trend for mean FEV1 when
   considering smoking status as ordered factor levels: 1 < 2 < 3 < 4 (use
   the R command factor with the ordered = TRUE option)?

5. (a) Compare the preceding results with the conclusion that would be
   reached by using a regression approach where one considers smoking status
   as a numerical variable, as well as its square, i.e., using the R command
   lm with a formula like FEV1 ~ smoking + I(smoking)^2.
   (b) What could explain the difference, if any?
