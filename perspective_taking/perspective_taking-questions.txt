Using a Rmarkdown custom report, you are asked to answer the following
questions:

1. (a) Give a numerical summary of the response variable (sample size, mean,
   standard deviation and range) for each levels of Daycare and Age group,
   separately. Factor levels will have to be recoded as described in the
   description file. Results should be printed in two Tables. (b) Perform
   the same numerical summary by considering the 4 treatments defined by
   crossing all factor levels together.

2. Use box-and-whiskers charts or density plots to show the distribution of
   individual increase in the composite score for each treatment.

3. Run a two-way ANOVA by considering increase factor score as the response
   variable and Daycare and Age group as explanatory variables, with their
   interaction. (a) Use an interaction plot to summarize the main
   findings. (b) Is the interaction significant at the 5% level? (c) If not,
   summarize the effect of each factor (partial eta squared and p-value).

4. Compare results obtained in (3) with those from a two-way ANOVA relying
   on (a) Type II or (b) Type III sum of squares which are available in the
   Anova() command from the car R package (install.packages("car")). Are results
   influenced by the order in which factors enter the model in each case?

   SS.)
